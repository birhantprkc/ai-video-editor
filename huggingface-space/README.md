# Timeline Studio

## Responsible use of deep synthesis

This tool uses deep-synthesis technology and is intended solely for technical research and learning.

Users must ensure that they:

- use only facial images or videos of themselves or people who have provided lawful authorization;
- do not create or distribute any illegal, infringing, false, or misleading content;
- do not present generated content as authentic footage or impersonate another person without their consent.

Users are solely responsible for any legal liability arising from violations of these requirements.

## Project updates

- **September 7, 2026 — Timeline markers:** add markers, chapters, ranges, and notes to organize long edits, mark musical beats, and record revision feedback. Edit titles, notes, times, and colors, search and jump between markers, and use M to mark the playhead. Markers stay at project time, are saved in portable `.timeline` projects, and support undo/redo in all 13 interface languages.
- **September 3, 2026 — Italian and Indonesian interfaces:** Timeline Studio now offers 13 interface languages. Italian and Indonesian include complete editor and runtime-message dictionaries, reviewed terminology for captions, timeline tools, Smart Frame, AI Music, vector design and generation plugins, matching fonts, and Whisper subtitle recognition.
- **September 1, 2026 — Sync-safe instant video readiness:** local and online imports now block only for a small device-adaptive set of real-PTS seed frames instead of 120–240 thumbnails, so a prepared filmstrip becomes editable much sooner without stretching one poster across the clip. Exact frames then refine the visible viewport first and continue through offscreen cells in midpoint-bisection order; thumbnail selection remains strictly at-or-before the requested source time, the playhead uses the live preview frame, and batched background commits pause during scrubbing.
- **August 29, 2026 — Generation connectors that finish the asset workflow:** Puter keeps its real popup sign-in and browser-direct generation, while new separate ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion WebUI/Forge plugins connect only to configurable loopback services. ComfyUI runs API-format workflows and imports declared image/video outputs; WebUI runs real txt2img/img2img requests. All completed media is added automatically to My assets, and the generic Hugging Face Spaces embed has been removed.
- **August 28, 2026 — Browser-local Smart Denoise:** the Visuals → AI Repair workspace now starts with a DRUNet-powered video denoiser offering current-frame comparison, four strength modes, source-audio preservation, and reversible application. Full-clip processing now streams source-rate WebCodecs frames through overlapped decode, persistent WebGPU sessions, pooled canvases/tensors/pixel buffers, and conservative denoise-residual reuse for low-change neighbors, with a PNG/FFmpeg compatibility fallback. The workflow is available on desktop and mobile in all 11 interface languages.
