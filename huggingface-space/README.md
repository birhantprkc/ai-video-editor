# Timeline Studio

## Responsible use of deep synthesis

This tool uses deep-synthesis technology and is intended solely for technical research and learning.

Users must ensure that they:

- use only facial images or videos of themselves or people who have provided lawful authorization;
- do not create or distribute any illegal, infringing, false, or misleading content;
- do not present generated content as authentic footage or impersonate another person without their consent.

Users are solely responsible for any legal liability arising from violations of these requirements.

## Project updates

- **September 12, 2026 — Best AI Tool badge:** the first-run language chooser now shows the Best AI Tool badge beside the Timeline Studio brand. The layout adapts to desktop and mobile, and the badge opens the external site in a new tab.
- **September 11, 2026 — WebMCP editing and video delivery:** 15 browser tools now cover reviewed caption changes, audio volume and fades, markers, main-visual splitting/deletion/duplication, existing-asset discovery and insertion, and picture-in-picture. Agents can prepare export settings, start the real editor exporter, inspect progress and actual output metadata, or cancel. Multi-operation edits retain conflict checks, ripple behavior, track locks and undo; repeated export requests do not trigger duplicate downloads. Tool and review copy covers all 13 interface languages.
- **September 10, 2026 — WebMCP for the live editor:** supported browsers can expose the open project to agents for structured inspection, preview seeking, and reviewed visual reorder/trim plans. The browser adapter reuses the shared command engine, checks for concurrent edits before applying, and preserves editor undo. Agent discovery and integration documentation are included; the root URL still opens directly into the editor.
- **September 8, 2026 — Smoother playhead dragging:** pointer updates are combined once per display frame, in-flight video seeks complete before advancing to the latest requested time, and timeline sampling is cached. Thumbnail refinement pauses throughout dragging; releasing the pointer resolves the exact final position with the same controls.
- **September 8, 2026 — Timeline markers for Agents:** Agents can read, add, update, and delete timeline markers through the Skill, CLI, and MCP to plan chapters and musical beats or record revision notes, with project inspection and semantic diff previews before applying changes.
