## Responsible use of deep synthesis

This tool uses deep-synthesis technology and is intended solely for technical research and learning.

Users must ensure that they:

- use only facial images or videos of themselves or people who have provided lawful authorization;
- do not create or distribute any illegal, infringing, false, or misleading content;
- do not present generated content as authentic footage or impersonate another person without their consent.

Users are solely responsible for any legal liability arising from violations of these requirements.

## Project updates

- **September 8, 2026 — Timeline markers for Agents:** Agents can read, add, update, and delete timeline markers through the Skill, CLI, and MCP to plan chapters and musical beats or record revision notes, with project inspection and semantic diff previews before applying changes.
- **September 7, 2026 — Timeline markers:** add markers, chapters, ranges, and notes to organize long edits, mark musical beats, and record revision feedback. Edit titles, notes, times, and colors, search and jump between markers, and use M to mark the playhead. Markers stay at project time, are saved in portable `.timeline` projects, and support undo/redo in all 13 interface languages.
- **September 3, 2026 — Italian and Indonesian interfaces:** Timeline Studio now offers 13 interface languages. Italian and Indonesian include complete editor and runtime-message dictionaries, reviewed terminology for captions, timeline tools, Smart Frame, AI Music, vector design and generation plugins, matching fonts, and Whisper subtitle recognition.
- **September 1, 2026 — Sync-safe instant video readiness:** local and online imports now block only for a small device-adaptive set of real-PTS seed frames instead of 120–240 thumbnails, so a prepared filmstrip becomes editable much sooner without stretching one poster across the clip. Exact frames then refine the visible viewport first and continue through offscreen cells in midpoint-bisection order; thumbnail selection remains strictly at-or-before the requested source time, the playhead uses the live preview frame, and batched background commits pause during scrubbing.
- **August 29, 2026 — Generation connectors that finish the asset workflow:** Puter keeps its real popup sign-in and browser-direct generation, while new separate ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion WebUI/Forge plugins connect only to configurable loopback services. ComfyUI runs API-format workflows and imports declared image/video outputs; WebUI runs real txt2img/img2img requests. All completed media is added automatically to My assets, and the generic Hugging Face Spaces embed has been removed.

Timeline Studio is a local-first browser video editor plus an Agent Skill for creating editable, multi-track `.timeline` projects. It combines visual assembly, timed captions, multilingual AI voiceover, overlays, audio tools, and deterministic browser rendering without turning the project into an opaque one-off script.

Use it when a user asks an Agent to make a vertical short from images, synchronize captions with narration, prepare localized versions, modify an existing editable project, or verify a browser video-editing workflow.

## What can it produce?

## What it can automate

- Inspect, dry-run, and transactionally modify a portable `.timeline` archive through a versioned JSON command plan.
- Move voiceover clips; update caption text and timing; unlink or relink caption/audio pairs.
- Import local visual or audio assets through the command runner with probing, SHA-256 integrity metadata, and portable archive embedding; use archived media for Visuals assembly and overlays.
- Use the browser compatibility path for AI speech, automatic captions, effects, unsupported editor operations, and final video export while more commands move into the shared registry.
- Preserve the editable project as the source of truth and verify the reopened result.

The command runner reads and writes `.timeline` projects, supports deterministic local media import, and can render its documented portable Visuals + Voiceover + Music subset to verified MP4. AI generation and richer composition rendering remain available through the local or hosted browser editor.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor --skill edit-timeline-studio
```

Skill installation copies the workflow but deliberately does not modify the host. On first local use, run the read-only dependency doctor:

```bash
node scripts/setup-host.mjs --check
```

If Node.js is missing, start with `sh scripts/bootstrap-host.sh --check` on macOS/Linux or `scripts/bootstrap-host.ps1` in Windows PowerShell. Both show an explicit language-runtime plan before their opt-in install mode.

If tools are missing, review the printed plan and explicitly authorize the interactive installer with `node scripts/setup-host.mjs --install`. It installs only declared media tools and pinned Python analysis packages in an isolated Timeline Studio runtime. It never bundles model downloads, GPU drivers, credentials, or paid services. See [host environment setup](references/host-environment.md).

Agent-driven Chinese and mixed Chinese/English narration uses Timeline Studio's owned Hojo TTS Light 80M FP16 browser bundle with two stable voices: 晴岚 and 若溪. Autoregressive generation runs on WebGPU and stable waveform decoding runs on WASM. It does not require MeloTTS, UniDic, or a separate Python voiceover environment. The first explicit generation downloads independently verified 16 MiB shards through ModelScope-first/Hugging-Face-fallback delivery and the editor caches them for repeat use. Product/software tutorials, vlog/travel/event recaps, product marketing/commerce shorts, and narrative/documentary condensations are narrated by default; existing authorized source speech is reused, and missing narration is synthesized locally before picture timing.

Claude Code and Codex can also install through GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh skill install MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor edit-timeline-studio --agent claude-code --scope user
gh skill install MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor edit-timeline-studio --agent codex --scope user
```

For repository development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor.git
cd ai-video-editor
npm install
npm run agent -- project.inspect /absolute/path/project.timeline
npm run dev
```
